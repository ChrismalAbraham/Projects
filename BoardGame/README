This Project is a boardgame that runs itself and determines who is the winner. At the beginning of the game you determine the number of players,
the size of the board, how many obstacles are on the board denoated by the character 'X', how many GoAgains are on the board denoted by the character 'O',
and at what maximum position on the board would the final obstacle be. After entering all the variables the program will simulate the game and determine
who is the winner by each character getting a random draw to advance in a round based game.
